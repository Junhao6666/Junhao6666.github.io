I am a master's student majoring in Data Science at the University of Malaya. Currently, I am in the first year of my graduate studies. I have a track record of receiving prestigious accolades, including a national scholarship, a National First Prize in the National College Student Mathematical Modeling Competition, a First Prize in the American College Student Mathematical Modeling Competition, and a Kaggle  Medal, among several other national and international achievements.

My research interests encompass a wide range of topics, including Graph Neural Networks (GNN), Large Language Models (LLM), multimodal data analysis, and more. I am actively exploring their applications in various domains such as social media, healthcare, transportation, and beyond. I am actively seeking research collaborators who share my enthusiasm for pushing the boundaries of knowledge in these areas.
